Time Spent: 3.8 hrs

Plan:
 - Achieve compatability for *.java DONE
 - implement BinSearch.java DONE
      i. Write binary search album (follow hw48 resources) DONE
     ii. Test on test cases DONE
 - implement LinSearch.java DONE
      i. Write linear search album (follow hw48 resources) DONE
     ii. Test on test cases DONE
 - implement timer/tester (https://github.com/ap251/library/blob/main/resources/currentTimeMillis.md) DONE
      i. Calculate the average time it takes to search for 100 random items in an ascending array of length 500 (for both linear and binary search) DONE
     ii. Calcualte the time it takes to find the last item (the worst-case scenario) DONE
    iii. Print a report that shows how long these searches took on average, along with the worst-case scenario DONE
     iv. Repeat i and ii for other array lengths (100, 10000, 1000000, 10000000, 25000000, 50000000) DONE
