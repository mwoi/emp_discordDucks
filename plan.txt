Time Spent: 3.0 hrs

Plan:
 - Achieve compatability for *.java DONE
 - implement BinSearch.java DONE
      i. Write binary search album (follow hw48 resources) DONE
     ii. Test on test cases DONE
 - implement LinSearch.java DONE
      i. Write linear search album (follow hw48 resources) DONE
     ii. Test on test cases DONE
 - implement timer/tester (https://github.com/ap251/library/blob/main/resources/currentTimeMillis.md) NOT DONE YET
      i. Calculate the average time it takes to search for 100 random items in an ascending array of length 500 (for both linear and binary search)
     ii. Print a report that shows how long the searches took on average
    iii. Repeat i and ii for other array lengths (100, 10000, 1000000, 10000000, 25000000, 50000000)
