/******************* yes i know, java comment in a .txt file. old habits.

DISCO:
 * You need to use prefix currentTimeMillis() with "System"
 * A comparable can be any data type which can be compared
 * Comparables need to be typecasted to int to be compared with integers
 * Binary search is much faster than linear search, particularly for longer arrays
 * Java can't handle Comparable arrays larger than 80,000,000, and can't even hold those if using many other large arrays
 
QCC:
 * Should the time for binary search be as low as it is for us? (0 ms, almost always)
 * How long would the array need to be so that linear search takes a statistically significant amount of time?
 
Gallery Tour:
 * Implementing a worst, best, and random target, so that with linear, any item at the start of the array would be quicker than binary, and any term in the middle 
   of the array will deem binary to be faster. 
 * Linear starts increasing exponentially as the number of items in the array start increasing, while binary remains relatively the same.
