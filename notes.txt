Time Spent: 3.5 hrs

/*******************

DISCO:
 * You need to use prefix currentTimeMillis() with "System"
 * A comparable can be any data type which can be compared
 * Comparables need to be typecasted to int to be compared with integers
 * Binary search is much faster than linear search, particularly for longer arrays
 * Java can't handle Comparable arrays larger than 80,000,000, and can't even hold those if using many other large arrays
 
QCC:
 * Should the time for binary search be as low as it is for us? (0 ms, almost always)
 * How long would the array need to be so that linear search takes a statistically significant amount of time?
