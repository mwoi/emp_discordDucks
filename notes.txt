DISCO:
 * You need to use prefix currentTimeMillis() with "System"
 * A comparable can be any data type which can be compared
 * Comparables need to be typecasted to int to be compared with integers
 * Binary search is much faster than linear search, particularly for longer arrays
 * Java can't handle Comparable arrays larger than 80,000,000, and can't even hold those if using many other large arrays
 
QCC:
 * Should the time for binary search be as low as it is for us? (0 ms, almost always)
 * How long would the array need to be so that linear search takes a statistically significant amount of time?
 
Gallery Tour:
 * Implementing a worst, best, and random target, so that with linear, any item at the start of the array would be quicker than binary, and any term in the middle 
   of the array will deem binary to be faster. (OrangeMarshmellows)
 * Linear starts increasing exponentially as the number of items in the array start increasing, while binary remains relatively the same. (MumbleCore)
 * Since the binary search shows 0ms for many of the tests, a good way to quantify it is the number of steps it took to locate the target, or the number of times
   the array was accessed. (Walrus)
 * The conclusion of this group was that as the number of terms in the array get bigger, Binary search takes way less time than Linear search. 
   They also had a similar conclusion as to where the terms in the array are very little, 
   Binary and Linear take almost the same time with Linear being a bit quicker, and the 
   difference at the start is small. (Consonants)
